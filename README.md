# 🔧 Spring Boot API Portfolio

This repository contains modular Spring Boot API projects designed for learning, demonstrations, and backend service architecture.

## 📁 Projects

- [Authentication Service](./authentication-service) – Stateless service responsible for processing login requests (via social providers) and delegating credential verification to external services.

- [Chat Service](./chat-service) – Manages real-time player chat, private messaging, and channel subscriptions. Built with WebSocket or Redis pub/sub for scalable delivery.
  
- [Client Gateway API](./client-gateway) – Acts as a secure gateway for client requests, responsible for routing, authenticating JWT tokens, and forwarding validated requests to internal APIs.

- [Eureka Server API](./eureka-server) – the central service registry module responsible for registering and managing all microservices within the distributed system.

- [Third Party Provider Verify API](./third-party-verify) – Handles third-party authentication via OAuth (Google, Facebook) and OTP, forwarding verified identities to the JWT issuer service for token generation.

- [Token Issuer API](./token-issuer) – Stateless service responsible for issuing, verifying, and refreshing different types of JWT tokens (access, refresh, service).

Each module is independently runnable and documented in its own README.md file.
